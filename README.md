This app consists of a text field which allows the user to enter a string,two drop down menus for color and size, two checkboxes for bold and italic and finally a listview of the fonts.On clicking a item in the list the app is required to launch a new activity which displays the text enter by the user with the selected color,size,style and font.The second activity should also have options for going back to the previous activity and exiting the application.
